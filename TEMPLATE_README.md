# KiCad template
Template for quickly setting up a structured KiCad workspace, to organize global/local symbols and footprints, and datasheets.


## Git and KiCad
Use Git to
- Work sequentially (one person at a time) per file:
  - E.g. multiple schematic files,
  - One works on schematics, another on PCB.
- Fetch the newest versions of schematics, PCBs, libraries, footprints.
- Versioning of designs (branches, tags).
- Symbol, footprint and 3D library management.
- Datasheet management for custom parts.

Don't use Git to:
- Work in parallel on a single file.
- Resolve conflicts / merge changes from multiple designers into one file.
- Those things just won't work.
